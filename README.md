#

Simple reactive WASM framework based on leptos-reactive

## todo

- add features for the dependencies to work

## quickstart

- install [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) as a WASM web application bundler

```sh
cargo install --locked trunk
```

- use a nightly release of the compiler for `leptos-reactive` features, instead of stable

```sh
rustup default nightly
```

- run the wasm

```sh
trunk serve
```
